	<h1>Float (makes no sense)</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>A block element when floated, no longer takes up teh whole parent. It;s no longer a block. It's not even a dispaly type. You cant add margin. </li>
		<li>The element, will go as far left( or right) as it possibly can, until it runs into another flaoting thign or it runs out of room</li>
		<li>A float element is in its own universe. They dont pass their height up to non-flaoting parents. Static + float = weird.</li>
		<ol>
			<li>IMPORTANT: to force a floated element to pass its height up to its parent... Make teh aprent float or set the parent to have overflow:hidden</li>
		</ol>
